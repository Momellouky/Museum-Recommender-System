# Project Description

This project created by Mohamed Mellouky and Nihal Dakkoune under the supervision of Mr. Eric Maisel, focuses on building an adaptive interface for exploring large cultural databases. Traditional search methods often fail to capture the complex relationships between elements like objects, events, places, and people. To address this, the adaptive interface personalizes the exploration experience based on user interactions, making it easier to discover and connect related information intuitively.

The system employs several innovative techniques:

- Random Generation: Creates unique, spontaneous room content to diversify exploration.
- Tag-Based Content Generation: Curates room content by assessing user interest in specific tags.
- Interest Redistribution: Dynamically adjusts interest levels across tags to maintain engagement.
- Taxonomy-Based Generation: Supports multi-level taxonomies for a layered approach to content discovery.
- This adaptive approach provides a personalized, evolving exploration experience, making it ideal for engaging with vast, interconnected cultural datasets.
